Well after being here for the past year, I’ve managed to compile some of my favorites/worthy mentions and made a what I like to call my “hall of fame” of different food categories and things to do in Singapore.

      "Content: So, I've been seeing trendy restaurants with items like a wagyu hamburger or a wagyu chopped cheese, and this doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Isn't the appeal of wagyu the specific kind of fat marbling, and wouldn't grinding it and using it to make a different shape completely remove that aspect? I know the fat ratios matter with ground beef/burgers, but grinding up wagyu seems like a trend-following scam that produces a regular hamburger that's just much more expensive. I don't know much about steak, though, so maybe I'm wrong.\n",
